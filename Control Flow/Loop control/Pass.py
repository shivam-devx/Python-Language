# does nothing, acts as placeholder and useful for writing skeleton code 
# prevents syntax errors when a block is required but logic is not yet written 

# Example:
# 1.
for i in range(1, 4):
    if i == 2:
        pass
    print("Value:", i)

# 2.

for char in "ABC":
    if char == "B":
        pass 
    print("Character:", char)
