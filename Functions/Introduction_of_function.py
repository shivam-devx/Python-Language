# a function is a block of code that perform specific task whenever its called 
# in bigger programs , where we have large amounts of code, it is advisable to create or use existing functions that
# make the program flow organized and neat
# There are two types of functions 1. built in functions and 2. user defined functions

# 1. A built in functuons are defined and pre coded in python and some example of built in functions are 
""" 
    min(), max(), len(), sum(), type(), range(), dict(), list(), tuple(), set(), print() and etc
"""
#2. user defined finctions to create for perform specific tasks as per our needs, such functions are called user defined functions
# Syntax:

# def function_name(parameter_name and type):
#     code and statements

# There is def is a keyword and function name is its name in round brackets are parametes then all code and statements perform here

# How function call:

def name(fname, lname):
    print("Hello,", fname, lname)

name("Shivam","Dohare") # that is function call with parameter and there some type are there

# its called functions arguments 
# 1. default arguments
# 2. keyword arguments
# 3. requird arguments
# 4. variable length arguments
