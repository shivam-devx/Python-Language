# Comments in Python program 

"""
    A comment is a part of the coding file that the programmer does not want to execute. Rather, the
    programmer uses it to either explain a block of code or to avoid the execution of a specific part of
    the code while testing.

# Example =:
           
        # It will execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
        # If the condition is false then it will execute another block of code.
        # p = 7
        #     if (p > 5):
        #         print("p is greater than 5.")
